		<h2>A Strategy Guide for Flappy Bird</h2>
		<p>Clearly a game of such depth requires a guide for success. Here goes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get rhythm. Learn to tap rhythmically so that the bird essentially travels in a straight line. After this it's just about varying the speed of taps so that the bird moves up and down but everything should defualt back to the straight line tap. Once you've got passed 10 pipes or so you'll have seen everything the game has to offer, just keep it going.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus more on the bottom pipe. If you're about to hit the bottom pipe, tap so that you don't hit it. As long as you don't make a souble tap you won't hit the top pipe.</p></li>
<li><p>Start low. When approaching a pipe it's better to aim to tap when you're just below the rim of the pipe.</p></li>
<li><p>Put it on red. Blue and yellow are inferior flyers and more prone to accidents. Focus on grinding red to level up.</p></li>
<li><p>Close your eyes. Tapping on the screen with your eyes closed is essentially the same as with your eyes open; may as well use the time to rest them.</p></li>
<li><p>Dismember your own thumbs. If this is what you're using them for you don't need them anyway.</p></li>
</ol>
